# Personal-Portfolio
Activity 1 on Web Development
This is my portofolio that I have built using html, css, and javascript. It includes various information about myself such as my name, personal background, skills, experiences, schools attended, projects that I have
made, and my contacts. In terms of features, it includes animations such as a hamburger nav, typing animation, hover effects, focus effects, and so much more. If you like what you see, do not hesitate to contact me
through the contact forms that I have created at my portfolio.
